1. First Brick Picked
=====================

Having set up the gazebo environment and spawned the baxter robot it is then necessary to initialise all our constituent nodes:

.. note:: If running the demo on the physical DE NIRO robot then ignore step 1. If running in simulation follow all steps below

1. Open a new terminal window to spawn the tables and bricks in simulation:

	.. code-block:: bash
	
		cd grasping_ws
		./baxter.sh sim
		rosrun baxter_sim_examples spawn_single.py 

.. note:: If this demo is being run on the physical DE NIRO robot, follow steps 1 through 8. If the demo is being run in simulation then use only steps 4,5 & 12

**Once the demo begins there is no need for further human input, the code operates autonomously using node topics.**

2. Right arm moves to centre
